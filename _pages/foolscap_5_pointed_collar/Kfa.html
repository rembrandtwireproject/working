name: Foolscap with Five-Pointed Collar, K.f.a. or K.i.
parent: center_point_straight
clarification: Watermark K.f.a. or K.i. can be distingushed by the crooked central collar point and the cross bar on the line extending to the roundels. K.f.a. and K.i. are very similar, but it is not clear whether they are identical or merely warped.
