      Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings

        The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project aims to simplify the process of identifying watermarks, which are often very difficult to tell apart. This program uses a decision tree model to guide researchers to a match with their sought watermark. The answer page provides information about the dating of that particular paper batch in Rembrandt’s oeuvre, and other Rembrandt prints appearing on the same paper. Eventually, all Rembrandt watermarks from Erik Hinterding’s 2006 catalogue will be included in this tool.

        The aim of this program is to allow researchers with watermarks of interest to upload their own watermark images to visually compare with examples in the decision tree. On the following page, you may upload and resize your own watermark image or proceed with one of the sample demonstration images we have provided.
