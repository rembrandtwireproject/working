layout: watermark
name: Eagle, Single-Headed, A.a.
parent: beak_crown
clarification: "Watermark A.a. has three notable characteristics: the eagle does not contain a Basel crosier at its center, its wings point downward, and a chain line touches but does not intersect its beak. Some of these characteristics are visible in this fragment image."
prints:
  - title: "Self-portrait (?) with jewel in cap"
    details: c. 1631 (B. 377 i / NHD 96w) British Museum, London (BM 1840-4-22-1). Quarto sheet
    notes: "This is a quarto sized print, meaning it was printed on one-quarter of a full sheet of paper. In the process of tearing the paper, the portion of paper containing the watermark was divided. This print contains a small portion of the watermark- just the eagleâ€™s head and crown, so it is thus considered a fragment. Other print(s) made from this sheet of paper would contain the remainder of the watermark, and it is possible that an etching could be found that contains the complementary fragment."
