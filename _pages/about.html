  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project is a cross-disciplinary research project largely driven by student effort under the guidance of Andrew C. Weislogel and C. Richard Johnson, Jr. The project carries on the legacy of watermark and paper study established by Erik Hinterding’s book <i>Rembrandt as an Etcher: The Practice of Production and Distribution</i>. In the process of manufacturing European laid papers, artisans attached watermarks—designs made from bent wire—to the grid of each paper mold to indicate the maker or geographical origin. Studying and systematically cataloguing Rembrandt’s watermarks can help reveal his printing practices and date his prints with increased accuracy. The WIRE project aims to build an interrogatory, computer-based interface that delivers a definitive watermark identification according to the fifty-four types of Rembrandt watermarks encompassed in Hinterding’s taxonomy. The project also aims to construct a larger database through engagement with other universities and museums.</p>
  <p>The WIRE identification tool is based on the model of the decision tree, a branching graph that allows the researcher to visualize all possible outcomes of a series of decisions. Students in the project construct decision tree branches for watermark types with binary answers about features of the watermark.  The interface allows a user to upload their own watermark image in an image editor box and select the matching watermark type. Users can then follow a short sequence of questions, with annotated images supplied for further guidance. The user may backtrack or start over at any time. After answering a series of questions, the user finds an exact match with the subvariant letter designation found in Hinterding’s 2006 book.</p>
