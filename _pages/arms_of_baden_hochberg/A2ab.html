layout: watermark
name: Arms of Baden-Hochberg, A'.a.b. or A'.b.
parent: top_quad_dip
clarification: "Watermarks A'.a.b. and A'.b. can be distinguished by a sharp dip in the top quadrant without the lion and the 'H' of 'HB' initials on the bottom on the side opposite the lion. Hinterding classifies these as different watermarks, but the WIRE project believes they are identical."
