      Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings

        The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project aims to simplify the process of identifying watermarks, which are often very difficult to tell apart. This program uses a decision tree model to guide researchers to a match with their sought watermark. The answer page provides information about the dating of that particular paper batch in Rembrandt’s oeuvre, and other Rembrandt prints appearing on the same paper. Eventually, all Rembrandt watermarks from Erik Hinterding’s 2006 catalogue will be included in this tool.

        For this demonstration version of the tool, a subset of watermark types is offered. Ultimately, researchers with watermarks of interest will be able to upload their own watermark images for comparison with examples in the decision tree. For now, we have provided several options to choose from.

        Choose a comparative image and follow the series of questions and images to find your watermark’s match.
