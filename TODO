TODO:

- Watermark: black line does not reach yellow border of end type
- Watermark: "Your watermark is:" should appear at the top, not the left side
- Watermark: Type occasionally spills over the circle border (e.g. Foolscap)
- Watermark: Also have comparative image "bubble"
- Index: remove.  Just jump directly to question 1.
- Question: If it's the first question, say "Reference Image Below"
- Overall: Call the user image "sample" ... at least for now.


FUTURE:

- Make user image draggable, movable around screen.  It needs to be doable on a tablet as well.  Interesting.
- Coarse Editor: rotate by manual degree
- Coarse Editor: remove arrow buttons, which are not useful.
- Fine Editor: Reverse b/w, color -> greyscale
- Watermark: Haven't decided on whether actual prints will appear, and how they will be referenced
- Identify: Auto magnify when you hove over
