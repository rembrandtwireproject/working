layout: watermark
name: IHS, A.j.
parent: width_chainspace
clarification: "Watermark A.j. can be distinguished by difference in the width of the chainspace that the 'H' is contained within versus the height of the cross from its top to the bottom of the cross bar of the 'H'.  The width of the chainspace should be greater than the height of the cross. This can be illustrated using marks on the straight edge of a piece of paper."
