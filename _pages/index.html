    Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project aims to simplify the process of confidently identifying watermarks in Rembrandt’s etchings; the watermark subvariants are often only subtly different and thus difficult to distinguish. This student-designed program is based on the model of a decision tree, a branching series of questions, which guides researchers to inspect the distinguishing features of a watermark type. The decision tree leads to a subvariant classification, and provides a description of the unique aspects of each subvariant. Eventually, all watermark types and subvariants from Erik Hinterding’s 2006 book <i>Rembrandt as an Etcher</i> will be included in this tool.

    For this demonstration version, a subset of watermark types is offered. Ultimately, researchers with watermarks of interest will be able to upload their own watermark images to the decision tree. For now, we have provided several options to choose from. Choose a comparative image and follow the series of questions and images to find your watermark’s match.
