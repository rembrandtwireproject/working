      Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings

      The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project aims to simplify the process of identifying watermarks, which are often very difficult to tell apart. This program uses a decision tree model to guide researchers to a match with their sought watermark, enabling rapid access to information on paper dating and the range of other plates printed on a given paper batch. Eventually, all Rembrandt watermarks from Erik Hinterding’s 2006 catalogue will be included in this tool.

        On the following page, researchers with watermarks of interest may upload and resize their own watermark images to visually compare against examples in the decision tree, or may experience the decision tree using one of the sample demonstration images provided.
