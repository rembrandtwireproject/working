    notes: "The WIRE project believes that the twinmark to this watermark, Basilisk E.a.b., is found on an impression of <i>Studies of the heads of Saskia and others</i>, 1636, held in a private collection, which we have provided as a comparative image for this exercise.</p> <p>A <i>twinmark</i> is one of two nearly identical watermarks affixed to a pair of paper molds used in rotation to make a batch of paper. The watermark in the image we have supplied is notably different from A.a.a. since there is an angular bend in the beak-side wing feather that causes the feathers to appear distorted. Another impression of the same print, <i>Studies of the heads of Saskia and others</i>, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, contains  an A.a.a. watermark. This provides further evidence that watermark A.a.b. (lower right) is a twinmark of A.a.a (lower left)."
