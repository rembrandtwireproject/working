    Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project aims to simplify the process of confidently identifying watermarks in Rembrandt’s etchings; the watermark subvariants are often only subtly different and thus difficult to distinguish. This student-designed program is based on the model of a decision tree, a branching series of questions, which guides researchers to inspect the distinguishing features of a watermark type. The decision tree leads to a subvariant classification, and provides a description of the unique aspects of each subvariant. Eventually, all watermark types and subvariants from Erik Hinterding’s 2006 book <i>Rembrandt as an Etcher</i> will be included in this tool.

    For this demo, a subset of watermark types are offered. Researchers with watermarks of interest can use their own watermark images to run through the decision tree. For other interested users, we have provided several options to choose from. With a comparative image at hand, either from our selection or your own, follow the series of questions and images to find your watermark’s subvariant classification.
